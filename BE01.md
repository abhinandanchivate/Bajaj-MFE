- **Security Tools:** OWASP ZAP, SonarQube

## 4. Microservices Breakdown

### 4.1 Authentication Service
**Responsibilities:**
- User registration and authentication.
- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- JWT and refresh token issuance.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA).

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /auth/register`
- `POST /auth/login`
- `POST /auth/refresh`
- `POST /auth/2fa`

**Security Measures:**
- OAuth 2.0 and JWT expiration strategies.
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt.
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

---

### 4.2 Product Service
**Responsibilities:**
- CRUD operations for products.
- Search and filtering features.
- Integration with recommendation engine.
- Product inventory management.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /products`
- `POST /products`
- `PUT /products/:id`

**Performance Optimization:**
- MongoDB indexing for query performance.
- Caching frequently accessed products using Redis.
- Horizontal scaling to handle high traffic.

---

### 4.3 Order Service
**Responsibilities:**
- Order placement and tracking.
- Integration with inventory management.
- Webhooks for status updates.
- Refund and cancellation workflows.

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /orders`
- `GET /orders/:id`
- `DELETE /orders/:id`

**Key Features:**
- Distributed transactions using Saga pattern.
- Event-driven architecture with Kafka.
- Order status lifecycle management.

---

### 4.4 Cart Service
**Responsibilities:**
- Cart management for users.
- Integration with promotions and discounts.
- Multi-session cart persistence.
- Wishlist functionality.

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /cart`
- `GET /cart`
- `DELETE /cart/:id`

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Session storage in Redis.
- Distributed state management using Kafka.
- Auto-recovery of cart state after session expiration.

---

### 4.5 Payment Service
**Responsibilities:**
- Payment processing via Stripe and PayPal.
- Secure handling of transactions.
- Order fulfillment upon payment success.
- Refund processing.

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /payment`
- `GET /payment/:id`
- `POST /payment/refund`

**Security Considerations:**
- PCI DSS compliance.
- Tokenized payment methods.
- Fraud detection and prevention.

---

## 5. System Architecture
### 5.1 Architectural Components
- **API Gateway:** NGINX or Kong for routing and load balancing.
- **Service Discovery:** Consul for microservice discovery.
- **Message Queue:** Kafka for asynchronous communication.
- **Observability:** ELK stack and Prometheus for monitoring.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Circuit breaker pattern with Resilience4j.
- **Data Replication:** Multi-region replication for high availability.

### 5.2 Deployment Architecture
```
User -> API Gateway -> Microservices -> Databases
```

## 6. Deployment with Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  auth-service:
    build: ./auth-service
    ports:
      - '5000:5000'
    environment:
      - MONGO_URI=${MONGO_URI}
      - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
  product-service:
    build: ./product-service
    ports:
      - '5001:5001'
  order-service:
    build: ./order-service
    ports:
      - '5002:5002'
  cart-service:
    build: ./cart-service
    ports:
      - '5003:5003'
  payment-service:
    build: ./payment-service
    ports:
      - '5004:5004'
```

## 7. Security Considerations
- **API Security:** OAuth 2.0 and API Gateway policies.
- **Data Security:** Encryption at rest and in transit.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Centralized log collection.
- **Penetration Testing:** Regular security audits.
- **Incident Response:** Defined response plans with automated alerts.

## 8. Performance Considerations
